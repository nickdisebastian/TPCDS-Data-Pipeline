-- Create a new fact table with several new metrics:
    -- sum_qty_wk: the sum sales_quantity of this week
        -- sum(catalog_sales.cs_quantity) group by date_dim.week_num, item UNION same from web_sales
    -- sum_amt_wk: the sum sales_amount of this week
        -- sum(catalog_sales.cs_quantity*catalog_sales.cs_sales_price) group by date_dim.week_num, item         UNION same from web_sales
    -- sum_profit_wk: the sum net_profit of this week
        -- sum(catalog_sales.cs_net_profit) group by date_dim.week_num
    -- avg_qty_dy: the average daily sales_quantity of this week 
        -- sum_qty_wk/7
    -- inv_on_hand_qty_wk: the itemâ€™s inventory on hand at the end of each week in all warehouses 
        -- sum(inventory.quantity_on_hand) group by warehouse, week, item
    -- wks_sply: Weeks of supply, an estimate metrics to see how many weeks the inventory can supply            the sales
    -- inv_on_hand_qty_wk/sum_qty_wk
    -- low_stock_flg_wk: Low stock weekly flag. During the week, if there is a single day, if                   [(avg_qty_dy > 0 && ((avg_qty_dy) > (inventory_on_hand_qty_wk)), then the flag is True.
-- Integrate Customer Dimension (Snowflake to Star schema): Customer (SCD Type 2) + Customer_Address +      Customer_Demographics + Household_Demographics + Income_Band
